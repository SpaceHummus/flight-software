Hummus in Space camera board quick start manual

UART configuration:
Baud rate:	115200
Start bit:	1 ('0')
Stop bit:	1 ('1')
Parity:		None
Bit Order:	lsb to msb


CPLD UFM (User Flash Memory) structure:
2 sectors (0,1), each holding 256 addresses of 16bits data.
Sector 0 (address 0x000 - 0x0FF): Holds configuration data for imager #0.
Sector 1 (address 0x100 - 0x1FF): Holds configuration data for imager #1.
Configuration data format:

Address LSB:	Data MSB											Data LSB
0x00			N/A 												N = Last valid address of configuration data
0x01			Data of 1st register in imager to be written		Address of 1st register in imager to be written
0x02			Data of 2nd register in imager to be written		Address of 2nd register in imager to be written
....
N				Data of last register in imager to be written		Address of last register in imager to be written


To get an image from a certain imager, the imager needs to be reset and configured (at least once after power up).
Once the imager is reset and configured, it can produce frame after frame without configuration (as long as it is not reset or powered down between frames).

Supported commands (received by board via UART):
Note: All even opcodes refer to Imager 0 and/or UFM sector 0. For any even opcode M, the odd opcode M+1 is the same command for Imager 1 and/or UFM sector 1.

0x00:		Get a single image frame from imager 0. Should be sent only after the imager is configured.
			Expected result: 137244 bytes of the image frame are sent back to the host.
			Once frame is received the board is ready for further commands.
			
0x02:		Reset imager 0. Should be sent before any access to imager 0 after the board powers up.
			Expected result: Once the operation is complete the board returns the command opcode back to the host.

0x04:		Configure imager 0. UFM sector 0 configuration data is read, and written to imager 0 registers.
			Expected result: Once the operation is complete the board returns the command opcode back to the host.

0x06:		Read from imager 0 address space. The opcode is followed by an address byte (0..255).
			Expected result: Once the operation is complete the read data from the specified register is sent back
			to the host (single byte).
			
0x08:		Write to imager 0 address space. The opcode is followed by an address byte (0..255), and then a data byte.
			Expected result: Once the operation is complete the board returns the command opcode back to the host.
			
0x0A:		Read from UFM sector 0 address space. The opcode is followed by an address byte (0..255).
			Expected result: Once the operation is complete the read data from the specified register is sent back
			to the host. 2 bytes total. First the LSB, then the MSB.
			
0x0C:		Erase UFM sector 0.
			Expected result: Once the operation is complete the board returns the command opcode back to the host.
			
0x0E:		Write to UFM sector 0 address space. The opcode is followed by an address byte (0..255), the LSB of the
			data to write, and the MSB of the data to write.
			Note: The UFM sector must be erased before any data can be written to it.
			Expected result: Once the operation is complete the board returns the command opcode back to the host.
			
0x10:		Change the state of the IR LEDs of imager 0 to constantly on (light).
			Expected result: Once the operation is complete the board returns the command opcode back to the host.

0x12:		Change the state of the IR LEDs of imager 0 to constantly off (dark).
			Expected result: Once the operation is complete the board returns the command opcode back to the host.
			
0x14:		Change the state of the IR LEDs of imager 0 to be controlled by imager 0.
			Note: this is the default state of the IR LEDs after the board is powered on.
			Expected result: Once the operation is complete the board returns the command opcode back to the host.

0x16:		Change the state of the white LEDs of imager 0 to constantly on (light).
			Expected result: Once the operation is complete the board returns the command opcode back to the host.

0x18:		Change the state of the white LEDs of imager 0 to constantly off (dark).
			Note: this is the default state of the white LEDs after the board is powered on.
			Expected result: Once the operation is complete the board returns the command opcode back to the host.
			
0x1A:		Change the state of the white LEDs of imager 0 to be controlled by imager 0.
			Expected result: Once the operation is complete the board returns the command opcode back to the host.

Nominal flow:
1.	After power up/ board reset:
	*	Send reset command to imager 0 and wait for reply.
	*	Send configuration command to imager 0 and wait for reply.
	*	Send reset command to imager 0 and wait for reply.
	*	Send configuration command to imager 0 and wait for reply.
2.	When a frame is required from imager X (0/1):
	*	Turn off ambient lighting.
	*	Set imager X IR LEDs state to the desired state if different than the default. Wait for reply.
	*	Set imager X white LEDs state to the desired state if different than the default.Wait for reply.
	*	Send a get frame command to imager X and wait for reply.
	*	Turn ambient light back on if required.
